<h2>OFFICIAL REPORT OF THE FIRE AT THE TOWER.</h2>
<p>The document with this title, that has got into the newspapers,
has been dressed up for the public eye. We have obtained the
original <em>draft</em>, and beg to administer it to our readers
<em>neat</em>, in the precise language it was written in.</p>
<h4>THE OFFICIAL REPORT.</h4>
<p>MR. SNOOKS says, that it being his turn to be on watch on the
night of Saturday, October 30th, he went to his duty as usual, and
having turned into his box, slept until he was amazed by shouts and
the rolling of wheels in all directions. The upper door of his box
being open, he looked out of it, and his head struck violently
against something hard, upon which he attempted to open the lower
door of his box, when he found he could not. Thinking there was
something wrong, he became very active in raising an alarm, but
could obtain no attention; and he has since found that in the hurry
of moving property from different parts of the building, his box
had been closely barricaded; and he, consequently, was compelled to
remain in it until the following morning. He says, however, that
everything was quite safe in the middle of the day when he took his
great-coat to his box, and trimmed his lantern ready for the
evening.</p>
<p>MRS. SNOOKS, wife of the above witness, corroborates the account
of her husband, so far as trimming the lanthern in the daytime is
concerned, and also as to his being encased in his box until the
morning. She had no anxiety about him, because she had been
distinctly told that the fire did not break out until past ten, and
her husband she knew was sure to be snug in his box by that
time.</p>
<p>JOHN JONES, a publican, says, at about nine o&rsquo;clock on
Saturday, the 30th of October, he saw a light in the Tower, which
flickered very much like a candle, as if somebody was continually
blowing one out and blowing it in again. He observed this for about
half an hour, when it began to look as if several gas-lights were
in the room and some one was turning the gas on and off very
rapidly. After this he went to bed, and was disturbed shortly
before midnight by hearing that the Tower was in flames.</p>
<p>SERGEANT FIPS, of the Scotch Fusileer (Qy. <em>Few sillier</em>)
Guards, was at a public-house on Tower-hill, when, happening to go
to the door, he observed a large quantity of thick smoke issuing
from one of the windows of the Tower. Knowing that Major Elrington,
the deputy governor, was fond of a cigar, he thought nothing of the
circumstance of the smoke, and was surprised in about half an hour
to see flames issuing from the building.</p>
<p>GEORGE SNIVEL saw the fire bursting from the Tower on Saturday
night, and being greatly frightened he ran home to his mother as
soon as possible. His mother called him a fool, and said it was the
gas-works.</p>
<p>THOMAS POPKINS rents a back attic at Rotherhithe; he had been
peeling an onion on the 30th of October, and went to the window for
the purpose of throwing out the external coat of the vegetable
mentioned in the beginning of his testimony, when he saw a large
fire burning somewhere, with some violence. Not thinking it could
be the Tower, he went to bed after eating the onion&mdash;which has
been already twice alluded to in the course of his evidence.</p>
<p>MR. SWIFT, of the Jewel-office, says, that he saw the Tower
burning at the distance of about three acres from where the jewels
are kept, when his first thought was to save the regalia. For this
purpose he rushed to the scene of the conflagration and desired
everybody who would obey him, to leave what they were about and
follow him to that part of the Tower set apart for the jewels.
Several firemen were induced to quit the pumps, and having
prevailed on a large body of soldiers, he led them and a vast
miscellaneous mob to the apartments where the crown, &amp;c., were
deposited. After a considerable quantity of squeezing, screaming,
cursing, and swearing, it was discovered that the key was missing,
when the jewel-room was carried by storm, and the jewels safely
lodged in some other part of the building. When witness returned to
the fire, it was quite out, and the armoury totally demolished.</p>
<p>The whole of the official report is in the same satisfactory
strain, but we do not feel ourselves justified in printing any more
of it.</p>
<hr />
<h3>A CON-CERTED CON.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;When is the helm of a ship like a certain English
composer?&rdquo;&mdash;said the double bass to the trombone in the
orchestra of Covent Garden Theatre, while resting themselves the
other evening between the acts of Norma.&mdash;The trombone wished
he might be <em>blowed</em> if he could tell.&mdash;&ldquo;When it
is <em>A-lee</em>&rdquo; quoth the bass&mdash;rosining his bow with
extraordinary delight at his own conceit.</p>
<hr />
<h3>RECONCILING A DIFFERENCE.</h3>
<p>Two literary partisans were lately contending with considerable
warmth, for the superiority of Tait&rsquo;s or Blackwood&rsquo;s
Magazine&mdash;till from words they fell to blows, and decided the
dispute by the <em>argumentum ad hominem</em>.&mdash;Doctor Maginn,
hearing of the circumstance, observed to a friend, that however the
pugnacious gentleman&rsquo;s opinions might differ with respect to
<em>Tait</em> and <em>Blackwood</em>, it was evident they were
content to decide them by a <em>Frazer</em> (<em>fray
sir</em>).</p>
<hr />
<h3>OUR WEATHERCOCK.</h3>
<p>The state of the weather, at all times an object of intense
interest and general conversation amongst Englishmen, has latterly
engaged much of our attention; and the observations which we have
made on the extraordinary changes which have taken place in the
weathercock during the last week warrant us in saying &ldquo;there
must be something in the wind.&rdquo; It has been remarked that Mr.
Macready&rsquo;s <em>Hamlet</em> and Mr. Dubourg&rsquo;s chimneys
have not <em>drawn</em> well of late. A smart breeze sprung up
between Mr. and Mrs. Smith, of Brixton, on last Monday afternoon,
which increased during the night, and ended in a perfect storm. Sir
Peter Laurie on the same evening retired to bed rather misty, and
was exceedingly foggy all the following morning. At the Lord
Mayor&rsquo;s dinner the <em>glass</em> was observed to rise and
fall several times in a most remarkable manner, and at last settled
at &ldquo;heavy wet.&rdquo; A flock of gulls were seen hovering
near Crockford&rsquo;s on Tuesday, and on that morning the milkman
who goes the Russell-square walk was observed to blow the tips of
his fingers at the areas of numerous houses. Applications for food
were made by some starving paupers to the Relieving Officers of
different workhouses, but the hearts of those worthy individuals
were found to be completely frozen. Notwithstanding the severity of
the weather, the nose of the beadle of St. Clement Danes has been
seen for nearly the last fortnight in full blossom. A heavy fall of
blankets took place on Wednesday, and the fleecy covering still
lies on several beds in and near the metropolis. Expecting frost to
set in, Sir Robert Peel has been busily employed on his <em>sliding
scale</em>; in fact, affairs are becoming very slippery in the
Cabinet, and Sir James Graham is already preparing to trim his sail
to the next change of wind. Watercresses, we understand, are likely
to be scarce; there is a brisk demand for &ldquo;bosom
friends&rdquo; amongst unmarried ladies; and it is feared that the
intense cold which prevails at nights will drive some unprovided
young men into the <em>union</em>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>THE BANE AND ANTIDOTE.</h3>
<p>We are requested to state that the insane person who lately
attempted to obtain an entrance into Buckingham Palace was not the
Finsbury renegade, Mr. Wakley. We are somewhat surprised that the
rumour should have obtained circulation, as the unfortunate man is
described as being of respectable appearance.</p>
<hr />
<h3>THE CORSAIR.</h3>
<h4>A POEM TO BE READ ON RAILROADS.</h4>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The sky was dark&mdash;the sea was rough;</p>
<p>The Corsair&rsquo;s heart was brave and tough;</p>
<p>The wind was high&mdash;the waves were steep;</p>
<p>The moon was veil&rsquo;d&mdash;the ocean deep;</p>
<p>The foam against the vessel dash&rsquo;d:</p>
<p>The Corsair overboard was wash&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>A rope in vain was thrown to save&mdash;</p>
<p>The brine is now the Corsair&rsquo;s grave!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As it is expected that the jogging and jerking, or the sudden
passing through tunnels, may in some degree interfere with the
perusal of this poem, we give it with the abbreviations, as it is
likely to be read with the drawbacks alluded to.</p>
<p>Wherever there is a dash&mdash;it is supposed there will be a
jolt of the vehicle.</p>

</div>
<hr />
<h3>&ldquo;STUPID AS A &lsquo;POST.&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p>The <em>Morning Post</em> has made another blunder. Lord
Abinger, it seems, is too Conservative to resign. After all the
editorial boasting about &ldquo;exclusive information,&rdquo;
&ldquo;official intelligence,&rdquo; &amp;c. it is very evident
that the &ldquo;<em>Morning Twaddler</em>&rdquo; must not be looked
upon as a direction <em>post</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p>We learn that a drama of startling interest, founded upon a
recent event of singular horror, is in active preparation at the
Victoria Theatre. It is to be entitled &ldquo;<em>Cavanagh the
Culprit; or, the Irish Saveloyard</em>.&rdquo; The interest of the
drama will be immensely strengthened by the introduction of the
genuine knife with which the fatal ham was cut. Real saveloys will
also be eaten by the Fasting Phenomenon before the audience.</p>
<hr />
<p>&ldquo;Never saw such <em>stirring</em> times,&rdquo; as the
spoon said to the saucepan.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<p>Having expressed the great gratification I should enjoy at being
permitted to become a member of so agreeable a society, I was
formally presented by the chairman with a capacious meerschaum,
richly mounted in silver, and dark with honoured age, filled with
choice tobacco, which he informed me was the initiatory pipe to be
smoked by every neophyte on his admission amongst the
&ldquo;Puffs.&rdquo; I shall not attempt to describe with what
profound respect I received that venerable tube into my
hands&mdash;how gently I applied the blazing match to its fragrant
contents&mdash;how affectionately I placed the amber mouth-piece
between my lips, and propelled the thick wreaths of smoke in
circling eddies to the ceiling:&mdash;to dilate upon all this might
savour of an egotistical desire to exalt my own merits&mdash;a
species of <em>puffing</em> I mortally abhor. Suffice it to say,
that when I had smoked the pipe of peace, I was heartily
congratulated by the chairman and the company generally upon the
manner in which I had acquitted myself, and I was declared without
a dissentient voice a duly-elected member of the
&ldquo;Puffs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The business of the night, which my entrance had interrupted,
was now resumed; and the chairman, whom I shall call Arden,
striking his hammer upon a small mahogany box which was placed
before him on the table, requested silence. Before I permit him to
speak, I must give my readers a pen-and-ink sketch of his person.
He was rather tall and erect in his person&mdash;his head was
finely formed&mdash;and he had a quick grey eye, which would have
given an unpleasant sharpness to his features, had it not been
softened by the benevolent smile which played around his mouth. In
his attire he was somewhat formal, and he affected an antiquated
style in the fashion of his dress. When he spoke, his words fell
with measured precision from his lips; but the mellow tone of his
voice, and a certain courteous <em>empressement</em> in his manner,
at once interested me in his favour; and I set him down in my mind
as a gentleman of the old English school. How far I was right in my
conjecture my readers will hereafter have an opportunity of
determining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our new member,&rdquo; said the chairman, turning towards
me, &ldquo;should now be informed that we have amongst us some
individuals who possess a taste for literary pursuits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very small taste,&rdquo; whispered a droll-looking
&lsquo;Puff,&rsquo; with a particularly florid nose, who was
sitting on my right hand, and who appeared to be watching all the
evening for opportunities of letting off his jokes, which were
always applauded longest and loudest by himself. My comical
neighbour&rsquo;s name, I afterwards learned, was Bayles; he was
the licensed jester of the club; he had been a punster from his
youth; and it was his chief boast that he had joked himself into
the best society and out of the largest fortune of any individual
in the three kingdoms.</p>
<p>This incorrigible wag having broken the thread of the
chairman&rsquo;s speech, I shall only add the substance of it. It
was, that the literary members of the &ldquo;Puffs&rdquo; had
agreed to contribute from time to time articles in prose and verse;
tales, legends, and sketches of life and manners&mdash;all which
contributions were deposited in the mahogany box on the table; and
from this literary fund a paper was extracted by the chairman on
one of the nights of meeting in each week, and read by him aloud to
the club.</p>
<p>These manuscripts, I need scarcely say, will form the series of
THE PUFF PAPERS, which, for the special information of the
thousands of the fair sex who will peruse them, are like the best
black teas, strongly recommended for their fine <em>curling
leaf</em>.</p>
<p>The first paper drawn by the chairman was an Irish Tale; which,
after a humorous protest by Mr. Bayles against the introduction of
foreign extremities, was ordered to be read.</p>
<p>The candles being snuffed, and the chairman&rsquo;s spectacles
adjusted to the proper focus, he commenced as follows:&mdash;</p>
<h3>THE GIANT&rsquo;S STAIRS.</h3>
<h4>A LEGEND OF THE SOUTH OF IRELAND.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be for quitting us so airly, Felix, <em>ma
bouchal</em>, it&rsquo;s a taring night without, and you&rsquo;re
better sitting there opposite that fire than facing this unmarciful
storm,&rdquo; said Tim Carthy, drawing his stool closer to the
turf-piled hearth, and addressing himself to a young man who
occupied a seat in the chimney nook, whose quick bright eye and
somewhat humorous curl of the corner of the mouth indicated his
character pretty accurately, and left no doubt that he was one of
those who would laugh their laugh out, if the <em>ould boy</em>
stood at the door. The reply to Tim&rsquo;s proposal was a jerk of
Felix&rsquo;s great-coat on his left shoulder, and a sly glance at
the earthen mug which he held, as he gradually bent it from its
upright position, until it was evident that the process of
absorption had been rapidly acting on its contents. Tim, who
understood the freemasonry of the manoeuvre, removed all the latent
scruples of Felix by adding&mdash;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more of that
stuff&mdash;where you know; and by the crook of St. Patrick
we&rsquo;ll have another drop of it to comfort us this blessed
night. Whisht! do you hear how the wind comes sweeping over the
hills? God help the poor souls at say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wissha amen!&rdquo; replied Tim&rsquo;s wife, dropping
her knitting, and devoutly making the sign of the cross upon her
forehead.</p>
<p>A silence of a few moments ensued; during which, each person
present offered up a secret prayer for the safety of those who
might at that moment be exposed to the fury of the warring
elements.</p>
<p>I should here inform my readers that the cottage of Tim Carthy
was situated in the deep valley which runs inland from the strand
at Monkstown, a pretty little bathing village, that forms an
interesting object on the banks of the romantic Lee, near the
&ldquo;beautiful city&rdquo; of Cork.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page243" name="page243"></a>[pg
243]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard such a jearful storm since the night
Mahoon, the ould giant, who lives in the cave under the <em>Giants
Stairs</em>, sunk the three West Ingee-men that lay at anchor near
the rocks,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Carthy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Felix can tell us, if he plazes, a quare story
about that same Mahoon,&rdquo; added Tim, addressing himself to the
young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right there, anyhow, Tim,&rdquo; replied
Felix; &ldquo;and as my pipe is just out, I&rsquo;ll give you the
whole truth of the story as if I was after kissing the book upon
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must know, then, it was one fine morning near
Midsummer, about five years ago, that I got up very airly to go
down to the beach and launch my boat, for I meant to try my luck at
fishing for conger eels under the Giant&rsquo;s Stairs. I
wasn&rsquo;t long pulling to the spot, and I soon had my lines
baited and thrown out; but not so much as a bite did I get to keep
up my spirits all that blessed morning, till I was fairly kilt with
fatigue and disappointment. Well, I was thinking of returning home
again, when all at once I felt something mortial heavy upon one of
my lines. At first I thought it was a big conger, but then I knew
that no fish would hang so dead upon my hand, so I hauled in with
fear and thrembling, for I was afeard every minnit my line or my
hook would break, and at last I got my prize to the top of the
water, and then safe upon the gunnel of the boat;&mdash;and what do
you think it was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In troth, Felix, sorra one of us knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, it was nothing else but a little dirty black
oak box, hooped round with iron, and covered with say-weed and
barnacles, as if it had lain a long time in the water. &lsquo;Oh,
ho!&rsquo; says myself, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s in rale good luck I am
this beautiful morning. Phew! as sure as turf, &rsquo;tis full of
goold, or silver, or dollars, the box is.&rsquo; For, by dad, it
was so heavy intirely I could scarcely move it, and it sunk my
little boat a&rsquo;most to the water&rsquo;s edge; so I pulled
back for bare life to the shore, and ran the boat into a lonesome
little creek in the rocks. There I managed somehow to heave out the
little box upon dry land, and, finding a handy lump of a stone, I
wasn&rsquo;t long smashing the iron fastenings, and lifting up the
lid. I looked in, and saw a weeshy ould weasened fellow sitting in
it, with his legs gothered up under him like a tailor. He was
dressed in a green coat, all covered with goold lace, a red scarlet
waistcoat down to his hips, and a little three-cornered cocked hat
upon the top of his head, with a cock&rsquo;s feather sticking out
of it as smart as you plase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good morrow to you, Felix Donovan,&rsquo; says the
small chap, taking off his hat to me, as polite as a
dancing-masther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Musha! then the tip top of the morning to
you,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s ashamed of yourself you ought
to be, for putting me to such a dale of throuble.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it, Felix,&rsquo; says he,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be proud to do as much for you another time. But
why don&rsquo;t you open the box, and let me out? &rsquo;tis many a
long day I have been shut up here in this could dark place.&rsquo;
All the time I was only holding the lid partly open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thank you kindly, my tight fellow,&rsquo; says
myself, quite &rsquo;cute; &lsquo;maybe you think I don&rsquo;t
know you, but plase God you&rsquo;ll not stir a peg out of where
you are until you pay me for my throuble.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Millia murdher!&rsquo; says the little chap.
&lsquo;What could a poor crather like me have in the world?
Haven&rsquo;t I been shut up here without bite or sup?&rsquo; and
then he began howling and bating his head agin the side of the box,
and making most pitiful moans. But I wasn&rsquo;t to be deceived by
his thricks, so I put down the lid of the box and began to hammer
away at it, when he roared out,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tare an&rsquo; agers! Felix Donovan, sure you
won&rsquo;t be so cruel as to shut me up again? Open the box, man,
till I spake to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, what do you want now&rsquo;!&rsquo; savs I,
lifting up the lid the laste taste in life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Felix, I&rsquo;ll give
you twenty goolden guineas if you&rsquo;ll let me out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Soft was your horn, my little fellow; your offer
don&rsquo;t shoot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give you fifty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A hundred.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;T won&rsquo;t do. If you were to offer me all the
money in the Cork bank I wouldn&rsquo;t take it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What the diaoul will you take then?&rsquo; says
the little ould chap, reddening like a turkey-cock in the gills
with anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rsquo; says I, making answer;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take the three best gifts that you can
bestow.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE KNATCHBULL TESTIMONIAL.</h2>
<p>A meeting, unequalled in numbers and respectability, was held
during the past week at the sign of &ldquo;<em>The Conservative
Cauliflower</em>,&rdquo; Duck-lane, Westminster, for the purpose of
presenting an address, and anything else, that the meeting might
decide upon, to Sir Edward Knatchbull, for his patriotic opposition
to &rsquo;pikes.</p>
<p>Mr. ADAM BELL, the well-known literary dustman, was unanimously
called to the Chair. The learned gentleman immediately responded to
the call, and having gracefully removed his fan tail with one hand
and his pipe with the other, bowed to the assembled multitude, and
deposited himself in the seat of honour. As there was no hammer in
the room, the inventive genius of the learned chairman, suggested
the substitution of his bell, and having agitated its clapper three
times, and shouted &ldquo;<em>Orger</em>&rdquo; with stentorian
emphasis, he proceeded to address the meeting:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wedgetable wendors and purweyors of promiscus poulte-ry,
it isn&rsquo;t often that a cheer is taken in this room for no
other than harmonic meetings or club-nights, and it is, therefore,
with oncommon pride that I feels myself in my present proud
persition. (<em>Werry good! and Hear, hear!</em>) You are all
pretty well aware of my familiar acquaintance with the nobs of this
here great nation. (<em>We is! and cheers.</em>) For some years
I&rsquo;ve had the honour to collect for Mr. Dark, night and day, I
may say; and in my mind the werry best standard of a real gentleman
is his dust-hole. (<em>Hear, hear! and He&rsquo;s vide avake!</em>)
You&rsquo;re hailed,&rdquo; continued the eloquent Adam,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re hailed by a sarvant in a dimity jacket; you
pulls up alongside of the curb; you collars your basket, and with
your shovel in your mawley, makes a cast into the hairy; one glance
at the dust conwinces you vether you&rsquo;re to have sixpence or a
swig of lamen-table beer. (<em>It does! and cheers.</em>) A man as
sifteses his dust is a disgrace to humanity! (<em>Immense cheering,
which was rendered more exhilarating by the introduction of
Dirk&rsquo;s dangle-dangles, otherwise bells.</em>) But
you&rsquo;ll say, Vot is this here to do with Sir Eddard?
I&rsquo;ll tell you. It has been my werry great happiness to clear
out Sir Eddard, and werry well I was paid for doing it. The Tories
knows what <em>jobs</em> is, and pays according-<em>ly</em>.
(<em>Here the Meeting gave the Conservative Costermonger
fire.</em>) The &rsquo;pinion I then formed of Sir Eddard has jist
been werrified, for hasn&rsquo;t he comed forrard to oppose them
rascally taxes on commercial industry and Fairlop-fair&mdash;on
enterprising higgling and &lsquo;twelve in a tax-cart?&rsquo; need
I say I alludes to them blessed &lsquo;pikes? (<em>Long and
continued cheers.</em>) Sir Eddard is fully aware that the
&lsquo;pike-men didn&rsquo;t make the dirt that makes the road, and
werry justly refuses to fork out tuppence-ha&rsquo;penny!
It&rsquo;s werry true Sir Eddard says that the t&rsquo;other taxes
must be paid, as what&rsquo;s to pay the ministers? But it&rsquo;s
highly unreasonable that &rsquo;pike-men is to be put alongside of
Prime Ministers, wedgetable wendors, and purveyors of promiscus
polte-ry! Had that great man succeeded in bilking the toll, what a
thing it would ha&rsquo; been for us! Gatter is but 3d. a pot, and
that&rsquo;s the price of a reasonable &lsquo;pike-ticket. That
wenerable and wenerated liquor as bears the cognominum of
&lsquo;Old Tom&rsquo; is come-atable for the walley of them werry
browns. But Sir Eddard has failed in his bould endeavour&mdash;the
&rsquo;pikes has it! (<em>Shame!</em>) It&rsquo;s for us to reward
him. I therefore proposes that a collection of turnpike tickets is
made, and then elegantly mounted, framed and glaziered, and
presented to the Right Honourable Barrownight.&rdquo; (<em>Immense
applause.</em>)</p>
<p>Mr. ALEC BILL JONES, the celebrated early-tater and spring-ingen
dealer, seconded the proposition, at the same time suggesting that
&ldquo;Old &rsquo;pike-tickets would do as well as new &rsquo;uns;
and everybody know&rsquo;d that second-hand tumpike-tickets
warn&rsquo;t werry waluable, so the thing could be done handsome
and reasonable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A collection was immediately commenced in the room, and in a few
minutes the subscription included the whole of the Metropolitan
trusts, together with three Waterloo-bridge tickets, which the
donor stated &ldquo;could ony be &rsquo;ad for axing
for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A deputation was then formed for the purpose of presenting this
unique testimonial when completed to Sir Edward Knatchbull.</p>
<p>It is rumoured that the lessees of the gates in the
neighbourhood of the Metropolis are trying to get up a counter
meeting. We have written to Mr. Levy on the subject.</p>

<h3>MUSICAL NEWS (NOOSE).</h3>
<p>We perceive from a foreign paper that a criminal who has been
imprisoned for a considerable period at Presburg has acquired a
complete mastery over the violin. It has been announced that he
will shortly make an appearance in public. Doubtless, his
performance will be <em>a solo on one string</em>.</p>

<p><span class="hide">T</span>he morning after the carousal
reported in our last chapter, the parties thereat assisting are
dispersed in various parts of London. Did a modern Asmodeus take a
spectator to any elevated point from which he could overlook the
Great Metropolis of Mr. Grant and England just at this period, when
Aurora has not long called the sun, who rises as surlily as if he
had got out of bed the wrong way, he would see Mr. Rapp ruminating
upon things in general whilst seated on some cabbages in Covent
Garden Market; Mr. Jones taking refreshment with a lamplighter and
two cabmen at a promenade coffee-stand near Charing Cross, to whom
he is giving a lecture upon the action of veratria in paralysis,
jumbled somehow or other with frequent asseverations that he shall
at all times be happy to see the aforesaid lamplighter and two
cabmen at the hospital or his own lodgings; Mr. Manhug, with a
pocket-handkerchief tied round his head, not clearly understanding
what has become of his latch-key, but rather imagining that he
threw it into a lamp instead of the short pipe which still remains
in the pocket of his pea-jacket, and, moreover, finding himself
close to London Bridge, is taking a gratuitous doze in the cabin of
the Boulogne steam-boat, which he ascertains does not start until
eight o&rsquo;clock; whilst Mr. Simpson, the new man, with the
usual destiny of such green productions&mdash;thirsty, nauseated,
and &ldquo;coming round&rdquo;&mdash;is safely taken care of in one
of the small private unfurnished apartments which are let by the
night on exceedingly moderate terms (an introduction by a policeman
of known respectability being all the reference that is required)
in the immediate neighbourhood of the Bow-street Police-office.
Where Mr. Muff is&mdash;it is impossible to form the least idea; he
may probably speak for himself.</p>
<p>The reader will now please to shift the time and place to two
o&rsquo;clock P.M. in the dissecting-room, which is full of
students, comprising three we have just spoken of, except Mr.
Simpson. A message has been received that the anatomical teacher is
unavoidably detained at an important case in private practice, and
cannot meet his class to day. Hereupon there is much rejoicing
amongst the pupils, who gather in a large semicircle round the
fireplace, and devise various amusing methods of passing the time.
Some are for subscribing to buy a set of four-corners, to be played
in the museum when the teachers are not there, and kept out of
sight in an old coffin when they are not wanted. Others vote for
getting up sixpenny sweepstakes, and raffling for them with
dice&mdash;the winner of each to stand a pot out of his gains, and
add to the goodly array of empty pewters which already grace the
mantelpiece in bright order, with the exception of two irregulars,
one of which Mr. Rapp has squeezed flat to show the power of his
hand; and in the bottom of the other Mr. Manhug has bored a foramen
with a red-hot poker in a laudable attempt to warm the heavy that
it contained. Two or three think they had better adjourn to the
nearest slate table and play a grand pool; and some more vote for
tapping the preparations in the museum, and making the porter of
the dissecting-room intoxicated with the grog manufactured from the
proof spirit. The various arguments are, however, cut short by the
entrance of Mr. Muff, who rushes into the room, followed by Mr.
Simpson, and throwing off his macintosh cape, pitches a large
fluttering mass of feathers into the middle of the circle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloo, Muff! how are you, my bean&mdash;what&rsquo;s
up?&rdquo; is the general exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, here&rsquo;s a lark!&rdquo; is all Mr. Muff&rsquo;s
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lark!&rdquo; cries Mr. Rapp; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re drunk,
Muff&mdash;you don&rsquo;t mean to call that a lark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful patriarchal old hen,&rdquo;
returns Mr. Muff, &ldquo;that I bottled as she was meandering down
the mews; and now I vote we have her for lunch. Who&rsquo;s game to
kill her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Various plans are immediately suggested, including cutting her
head off, poisoning her with morphia, or shooting her with a little
cannon Mr Rapp has got in his locker; but at last the majority
decide upon hanging her. A gibbet is speedily prepared, simply
consisting of a thigh-bone laid across two high stools; a piece of
whip cord is then noosed round the victim&rsquo;s neck; and she is
launched into eternity, as the newspapers say&mdash;Mr. Manhug
attending to pull her legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depend upon it that&rsquo;s a humane death,&rdquo;
remarks Mr. Jones. &ldquo;I never tried to strangle a fowl but
once, and then I twisted its neck bang off. I know a capital plan
to finish cats though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw it off&mdash;put it up&mdash;let&rsquo;s have
it,&rdquo; exclaim the circle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then; you must get their necks in a slip knot and
pull them up to a key-hole. They can&rsquo;t hurt you, you know,
because you are the other side the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, capital&mdash;quite a wrinkle,&rdquo; observes Mr.
Muff. &ldquo;But how do you catch them first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put a hamper outside the leads with some valerian in it,
and a bit of cord tied to the lid. If you keep watch, you may bag
half-a-dozen in no time; and strange cats are fair game for
everybody,&mdash;only some of them are rum &rsquo;uns to
bite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment, a new Scotch pupil, who is lulling himself into
the belief that he is studying anatomy from some sheep&rsquo;s eyes
by himself in the Museum, enters the dissecting-room, and mildly
asks the porter &ldquo;what a heart is worth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rdquo; shouts Mr. Rapp;
&ldquo;it depends entirely upon what&rsquo;s trumps;&rdquo;
whereupon the new Scotch pupil retires to his study as if he was
shot, followed by several pieces of cinders and tobacco-pipe,</p>
<p>During the preceding conversation, Mr. Muff cuts down the victim
with a scalpel; and, finding that life has departed, commences to
pluck it, and perform the usual post-mortem abdominal examinations
attendant upon such occasions. Mr. Rapp undertakes to manufacture
an extempore spit, from the rather dilapidated umbrella of the new
Scotch pupil, which he has heedlessly left in the dissecting-room.
This being completed, with the assistance of some wire from the
ribs of an old skeleton that had hung in a corner of the room ever
since it was built, the hen is put down to roast, presenting the
most extraordinary specimen of trussing upon record. Mr. Jones
undertakes to buy some butter at a shop behind the hospital; and
Mr. Manhug, not being able to procure any flour, gets some starch
from the cabinet of the lecturer on Materia Medica, and powders it
in a mortar which he borrows from the laboratory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To revert to cats,&rdquo; observes Mr. Manhug, as he sets
himself before the fire to superintend the cooking; &ldquo;it
strikes me we could contrive no end to fun if we each agreed to
bring some here one day in carpet-bags. We could drive in plenty of
dogs, and cocks, and hens, out of the back streets, and then let
them all loose together in the dissecting-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a sprinkling of rats and ferrets,&rdquo; adds Mr.
Rapp. &ldquo;I know a man who can let us have as many as we want.
The skrimmage would be immense, only I shouldn&rsquo;t much care to
stay and see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; replies Mr. Muff.
&ldquo;Of course, we must get on the roof and look at it through
the skylights. You may depend upon it, it would be the finest card
we ever played.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How gratifying to every philanthropist must be these proofs of
the elasticity of mind peculiar to a Medical Student! Surrounded by
scenes of the most impressive and deplorable nature&mdash;in
constant association with death and contact with disease&mdash;his
noble spirit, in the ardour of his search after professional
information, still retains its buoyancy and freshness; and he
wreaths with roses the hours which he passes in the
dissecting-room, although the world in general looks upon it as a
rather unlikely locality for those flowers to shed their perfume
over!</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, Muff, where did you get to last night after
we all cut?&rdquo; inquires Mr. Rapp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s what I am rather anxious to find out
myself,&rdquo; replies Mr. Muff; &ldquo;but I think I can collect
tolerably good reminiscences of my travels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us all about it then,&rdquo; cry three or four.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure&mdash;only let&rsquo;s have in a little
more beer; for the heat of the fire in cooking produces rather too
rapid an evaporation of fluids from the surface of the
body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, blow your physiology!&rdquo; says Rapp. &ldquo;You
mean to say you&rsquo;ve got a hot copper&mdash;so have I. Send for
the precious balm, and then fire away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And accordingly, when the beer arrives, Mr. Muff proceeds with
the recital of his wanderings.</p>

<h3>OUR CITY ARTICLE.</h3>
<p>An alarming forgery of Mendicity Society&rsquo;s tickets has
been discovered in Red Lion Square, and has caused much
conversation at the doors of most of the gin palaces. Our readers
are probably aware what these tickets are, though, being a
particular class of security, there is not a great deal publicly
done in them. They are issued to certain subscribers, who pay a
guinea per year towards housing a Secretary and some other officers
in a moderate-sized house, in the kitchen of which certain soup is
prepared, which is partaken of by a number of persons called the
Board, who are said to taste it and see that it is good; and if
there is any left, which may occasionally happen, the poor are
allowed to finish it. This valuable privilege is secured by
tickets; and these tickets are found to be forged to a very large
amount&mdash;some say indeed to the amount of 14,000 basins. It is
not usual to pay off these soup tickets, but a sort of interest can
be had upon them by standing just over the railings of the house in
Red Lion Square, when the Secretary&rsquo;s dinner is being cooked
or served up, and a certain amount of savoury steam is then put
into circulation. The house has been besieged all day with
&ldquo;innocent holders,&rdquo; who, on giving their tickets in,
cannot get them back again. The genuine tickets are known by the
stamp, which is a soup plate <em>rampant</em>, and a spoon
<em>argent</em>,&mdash;the latter being the emblem of the
subscribers.</p>
<p>A great deal is said of a new company, whose object is to take
advantage of a well-known fact in chemistry. It is known that
diamonds can be resolved into charcoal, as well as that charcoal
can be ultimately reduced to air; and a company is to be founded
with the view of simply <em>reversing the process</em>. Instead of
getting air from diamonds, their object will be to get diamonds
from air; and in fact the chief promoters of it have generally
drawn from that source the greater part of their capital. The whole
sum for shares need not be paid up at once; but the Directors will
be satisfied in the first instance with 10 per cent. on the whole
sum to be raised from the adventurers. It is intended to declare a
dividend at the earliest possible period, which will be directly
the first diamond has been made by the new process.</p>

<h2>PUNCH AND THE SWISS GIANTESS!</h2>
<h3>SHERIFFS&rsquo; COURT.&mdash;WEDNESDAY.</h3>
<h4>BONBON <em>versus</em> PUNCH.</h4>
<div class="note">
<p>[This important cause came on for trial on Wednesday last. That
it has not been reported in the morning papers is doubtless to be
attributed to the most reckless bribery on the part of the
plaintiff. He has, no doubt, sought to hush up his infamy; the
defendant has no such contemptible cowardice. Hence a special
reporter was engaged for PUNCH. The trial is given here, firstly,
for the beautiful illustration it affords of the philosophy of the
English law of <em>crim. con.</em>; and secondly on a
principle&mdash;for PUNCH has principles&mdash;laid down by the
defendant in his course of public life, to show himself to the
world the man he really is. In pursuit of this moral and
philosophical object, should the waywardness of his genius ever
induce PUNCH to cut a throat, pick a pocket, or, as a Middlesex
magistrate (for PUNCH has been upon the bench many a year), to
offer for sale a tempting lot of liberty to any competent
captive,&mdash;should PUNCH rob as a vulgar Old Bailey delinquent,
or genteelly swindle as an Aldermanic share-holder,&mdash;in each
and every of these cases there will, <em>on discovery</em>, be the
fullest report of the same in PUNCH&rsquo;S own paper, PUNCH being
deeply impressed with the belief that an exhibition of the
weaknesses of a great man <span class="pagenum"><a id="page246"
name="page246"></a>[pg 246]</span> is highly beneficial to public
philosophy and public morals. PUNCH now retires in favour of his
&ldquo;own&rdquo; reporter.]</p>
</div>
<p>As early as six o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the neighbourhood
of the court presented a most lively and bustling aspect. Carriages
continued to arrive from the west-end; and we recognised scores of
ladies whose names are familiar to the readers of the <em>Court
Journal</em> and <em>Morning Post</em>. Several noblemen, amateurs
of the subject, arrived on horseback. By eight o&rsquo;clock the
four sides of Red Lion-square were, if we may be allowed the
metaphor, a mass of living heads. We owe a debt of gratitude to Mr.
Davis, the respected and conscientious officer for the Sheriff of
Middlesex; that gentleman, in the kindest spirit of hospitality,
allowing us six inches of his door-step when the crowd was at its
greatest pressure. Several inmates of Mr. Davis&rsquo;s delightful
mansion had a charming view of the scene from the top windows,
where we observed bars of the most picturesque and <em>moyen
age</em> description. At ten minutes to nine, Mr. Charles Phillips,
counsel for the plaintiff, arrived in Lamb&rsquo;s Conduit-passage,
and was loudly cheered. On the appearance of Mr. Adolphus, counsel
for the defendant, a few miscreants in human shape essayed groans
and hisses; they were, however, speedily put down by the New
Police.</p>
<p>We entered the court at nine o&rsquo;clock. The galleries were
crowded with rank, beauty, and fashion. Conflicting odours of
lavender, musk, and <em>Eau de Cologne</em> emanated from ladies on
the bench, most of whom were furnished with opera-glasses,
sandwich-boxes, and species of flasks, vulgarly known as
pocket-pistols. In all our experience we never recollect such a
thrill as that shot through the court, when the crier of the same
called out&mdash;</p>
<h4>BONBON <em>v</em>. PUNCH!</h4>
<p>Mr. SMITH (a young yet rising barrister with green spectacles)
with delicate primness opened the case. A considerable pause,
when&mdash;</p>
<p>Mr. CHARLES PHILLIPS, having successfully struggled with his
feelings, rose to address the court for the plaintiff. The learned
gentleman said it had been his hard condition as a barrister to see
a great deal of human wickedness; but the case which, most
reluctantly, he approached that day, made him utterly despair of
the heart of man. He felt ashamed of his two legs, knowing that the
defendant in this case was a biped. He had a horror of the
mysterious iniquities of human nature&mdash;seeing that the
defendant was a man, a housekeeper, and, what in this case trebled
his infamy, a husband and a father. Gracious Heaven! when he
reflected&mdash;but no; he would confine himself to a simple
statement of facts. That simplicity would tell with a double-knock
on the hearts of a susceptible jury. The afflicted, the agonised
plaintiff was a public man. He was, until lately, the happy
possessor of a spotless wife and an inimitable spring-van. It was
was a union assented to by reason, smiled on by prudence. Mr.
Bonbon was the envied owner of a perambulating exhibition: he
counted among his riches a Spotted Boy, a New Zealand Cannibal, and
a Madagascar Cow. The crowning rose was, however, to be gathered,
and he plucked, and (as he fondly thought) made his own for ever,
the Swiss Giantess! Mr. Bonbon had wealth in his van&mdash;the lady
had wealth in herself; hence it was, in every respect, what the
world would denominate an equal match.</p>
<p>The learned counsel said he would call witnesses to prove the
blissful atmosphere in which the parties lived, until the
defendant, like a domestic upas-tree, tainted and polluted it. That
van was another Eden, until PUNCH, the serpent, entered. The lady
was a native of Switzerland&mdash;yes, of Switzerland. Oh, that he
(the learned gentleman) could follow her to her early
home!&mdash;that he could paint her with the first blush and dawn
of innocence, tinting her virgin cheek as the morning sun tinted
the unsullied snows of her native Jungfrau!&mdash;that he could
lead the gentlemen of the jury to that Swiss cottage where the
gentle F&eacute;licit&eacute; (such was the lady&rsquo;s name)
lisped her early prayer&mdash;that he could show them the mountains
that had echoed with her songs (since made so very popular by
Madame Stockhausen)&mdash;that he could conjure up in that court
the goats whose lacteal fluid was wont to yield to the pressure of
her virgin fingers&mdash;the kids that gambolled and made holiday
about her&mdash;the birds that whistled in her path&mdash;the
streams that flowed at her feet&mdash;the avalanches, with their
majestic thunder, that fell about her. Would he could subpoena such
witnesses! then would the jury feel, what his poor words could
never make them feel&mdash;the loss of his injured client. On one
hand would be seen the simple Swiss maiden&mdash;a violet among the
rocks&mdash;a mountain dove&mdash;an inland pearl&mdash;a rainbow
of the glaciers&mdash;a creature pure as her snows, but not as
cold; and on the other the fallen wife&mdash;a monument of shame!
This was a commercial country; and the jury would learn with
additional horror that it was in the sweet confidence of a
commercial transaction that the defendant obtained access to his
interesting victim. Yes, gentlemen, (said Mr. P.,) it was under the
base, the heartless, the dastardly excuse of business, that the
plaintiff poured his venom in the ear of a too confiding woman. He
had violated the sacred bonds of human society&mdash;the noblest
ties that hold the human heart&mdash;the sweetest tendrils that
twine about human affections. This should be shown to the jury.
Letters from the plaintiff would be read, in which his
heart&mdash;or rather that ace of spades he carried in his breast
and called his heart&mdash;would be laid bare in open court. But
the gentlemen of the jury would teach a terrible lesson that day.
They would show that the socialist should not guide his accursed
bark into the tranquil seas of domestic comfort, and anchor it upon
the very hearthstone of conjugal felicity. No&mdash;as the
gentlemen of the jury were husbands and fathers, as they were
fathers and not husbands, as they were neither one nor the other,
but hoped to be both&mdash;they would that day hurl such a
thunderbolt at the pocket of the defendant&mdash;they would so
thrice-gild the incurable ulcers of the plaintiff, that all the
household gods of the United Empire would hymn them to their mighty
rest, and Hymen himself keep continual carnival at their
amaranthine hearths. &ldquo;Gentlemen of the jury (said the learned
counsel in conclusion), I leave you with a broken heart in your
hands! A broken heart, gentlemen! Creation&rsquo;s masterpiece,
flawed cracked, SHIVERED TO BITS! See how the blood flows from
it&mdash;mark where its strings are cut and cut&mdash;its delicate
fibres violated&mdash;its primitive aroma evaporated to all the
winds of heaven. Make that heart your own, gentlemen, and say at
how many pounds you value the demoniac damage. And oh, may your
verdict still entitle you to the blissful confidence of that
divine, purpureal sex, the fairest floral specimens of which I see
before me! May their unfolding fragrance make sweet your daily
bread; and when you die, from the tears of conjugal love, may thyme
and sweet marjoram spring and blossom above your graves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the emotion of the court was unparalleled in the memory of
the oldest attorney. Showers of tears fell from the gallery, so
that there was a sudden demand for umbrellas.</p>
<p>The learned counsel sat down, and, having wiped his eyes, ate a
sandwich.</p>
<p>There were other letters, but we have selected the least
glowing. Mr. Charles Phillips then called his witnesses.</p>
<p>Peter Snooks examined: Was employed by plaintiff; recollected
defendant coming to the van to propose a speculation, in which
Madame Bonbon was to play with him. Defendant came very often when
plaintiff was out. Once caught Madame Bonbon on defendant&rsquo;s
knee. Once heard Madame Bonbon say, &ldquo;Bless your darling
nose!&rdquo; Was sure it was defendant&rsquo;s nose. Was shocked at
her levity, but consented to go for gin&mdash;Madame found the
money. Had a glass myself, and drank their healths. Plaintiff never
beat his wife; he couldn&rsquo;t: they were of very uneven habits;
she was seven feet four, plaintiff was four feet seven.</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Adolphus: Plaintiff was dreadfully
afflicted at infidelity of his wife: had become quite
desperate&mdash;never sober since; was never sober before. On first
night of the news plaintiff was quite delirious; took six plates of
alamode beef, and two pots of porter.</p>
<p>Sarah Pillowcase examined: Was chambermaid at the Tinder-box and
Flint, New Cut; had known defendant since she was a
child&mdash;also knew plaintiff&rsquo;s wife. They came together on
the 1st of April, about twelve at night. Understood they had been
in a private box at the Victoria with an order. They had twelve
dozen of oysters for supper, and eight Welch-rabbits: the lady
found the money. Thought, of course, they were married, or would
rather have died than have served them. They made a hearty
breakfast: the lady found the money.</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Adolphus: Would swear to the lady, as she
had once paid a shilling to see her.</p>
<p>(Here it was intimated by the learned judge that ladies might
leave the court if they chose; it was evident, however, that no
lady heard such intimation, as no lady stirred.)</p>
<p>Cross-examination continued: Yes, would swear it. Knew the
obligation of an oath, and would swear it.</p>
<p>This ended the case for the plaintiff.</p>
<p>Mr. ADOLPHUS addressed the court for the defendant. He had not
the golden tongue&mdash;no, he was not blessed with the oratory of
his learned friend. He would therefore confine himself to the
common sense view of the question. He was not talking to Arcadian
shepherds (he was very happy to see his own butcher in the
jury-box), but to men of business. If there had been any arts
practised, it was on the side of the plaintiff&rsquo;s wife. His
client had visited the plaintiff out of pure compassion. The
plaintiff&rsquo;s show was a failing concern; his client, with a
benevolence which had marked his long career, wished to give him
the benefit of his own attractions, joined to those of the woman.
Well, the plaintiff knew the value of money, and therefore left his
wife and the defendant to arrange the affair between them.
&ldquo;Gentlemen of the jury,&rdquo; continued the learned counsel,
&ldquo;it must appear to you, that on the part of the plaintiff
this is not an affair of the heart, but a matter of the
breeches&rsquo; pocket. He leaves his wife&mdash;a fascinating,
versatile creature&mdash;with my client, I confess it, an
acknowledged man of gallantry. Well, the result is&mdash;what was
to be expected. My learned friend has dwelt, with his accustomed
eloquence, on his client&rsquo;s broken heart. I will not speak of
his heart; but I must say that the man who, bereaved of the partner
of his bosom, can still eat six plates of alamode beef, must have a
most excellent stomach. Gentlemen, beware of giving heavy damages
in this case, or otherwise you will unconsciously be the promoters
of great immorality. This is no paradox, gentlemen; for I am
credibly informed that if the man succeed in getting large damages,
he will immediately take his wife home to his bosom and his van,
and instead of exhibiting her, as he has hitherto done, for one
penny, he will, on the strength of the notoriety of this trial, and
as a man knowing the curiosity of society, immediately advance that
penny to threepence. You will, therefore, consider your verdict,
gentlemen, and give such moderate damages as will entirely mend the
plaintiff&rsquo;s broken heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The jury, without retiring from the box, returned a verdict of
&ldquo;Damages One Farthing!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>We are credibly informed&mdash;though the evidence was not
adduced in court&mdash;that Monsieur Bonbon first suspected his
dishonour from his wife&rsquo;s hair papers. She had most
negligently curled her tresses in the soft paper epistles of her
<em>innamorato</em>.</p>

<h2>THE FETES FOR THE POLISH&mdash;AND FATE OF THE BRITISH
POOR.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Charity begins at home,&rdquo; says, or rather said, an
admirable old proverb; but alack! the adage, or the times, or both,
are out of joint&mdash;the wholesome maxim has lost its
force&mdash;and homes for Charity must now be far as the
<em>Poles</em> asunder, ere the benign influence of the weeping
goddess can fall upon its wretched supplicants.</p>
<p>In private life the neglect of a domestic hearth for the
vainglorious squandering abroad of the means that could and ought
to render that the chief seat of comfort and independence, calls
down upon the thoughtless and heartless squanderer and abuser of
his means the just indignation and merited contempt of every
thinking and properly constituted mind. The &ldquo;Charity&rdquo;
that does not begin at home is the worst species of unjustifiable
prodigality, and the first step to the absolute ruin of the
&ldquo;nearest and dearest&rdquo; for the sake of the profligate
and abandoned. And no sophistry can justify the apparent liberality
that deprives others of their just and urgent dues.</p>
<p>It may be and is most noble to feed the widow and to clothe the
orphan; but where is the beneficence of the deed if the wife and
children of the ostentatious donor&mdash;the victims of the
performance of such acts&mdash;are left themselves to endure misery
and privations, from which his inadequate means cannot exempt the
stranger and the giver&rsquo;s own household!</p>
<p>The sparrow who unwittingly rears the cuckoo&rsquo;s spurious
offspring, tending with care the ultimate destroyer of its own
young, does so in perfect ignorance of the results about to follow
the misplaced affection. The cravings of the interloper are
satisfied to the detriment of its own offspring; and when the
full-fledged recipient of its misplaced bounty no longer needs its
aid, the thankless stranger wings its way on its far-off course,
selfishly careless of the fostering bird that brought it into life;
and this may be looked upon as one of the results generally
attendant upon a blind forgetfulness of <em>where</em> our first
endeavours for the amelioration of the wants of others should be
made.</p>
<p>It has ever been the crying sin of the vastly sympathetic to
weep for the miseries of the distant, and blink at the wretchedness
their eyes&mdash;if not their hearts&mdash;must ache to see. Their
charity must have its proper stage, their sentiments the proper
objects,&mdash;and their imaginations the undisturbed right to
revel in the supposititious grievances of the far-off wretched and
oppressed. The poor black man! the tortured slave! the benighted
infidel! the debased image of his maker! the sunken bondsman! These
terms must be the &ldquo;Open sesame&rdquo; for the breasts from
whence spring bibles, bribes, blankets, glass beads, pocket-combs,
tracts, teachers, missions, and missionaries. Oppression is what
they would put down; but then the oppression must be of
&ldquo;foreign manufacture.&rdquo; Your English, genuine home-made
article, though as superior in strength and endurance as our own
canvas is to the finest fold of gauze-like cambric, is in their
opinion a thing not worth a thought. A half oppressed Caffre is an
object of ten thousand times more sympathy than a wholly oppressed
Englishman; a half-starved Pole the more fitting recipient of the
same proportion of actual bounty to a wholly starving peasant of
our own land of law and liberty.</p>
<p>Let one-tenth the disgusting details so nobly exposed in the
<em>Times</em> newspaper, as to the frightful state of some of our
legalised poor law inquisitions, appear as extracts from the
columns of a <em>foreign</em> journal, stating such treatment to
exist amongst a foreign population, and mark the result. Why, the
town would teem with meetings and the papers with speeches. Royal,
noble, and honourable chairmen and vice chairmen would launch out
their just anathemas against the heartless despots whose realms
were disgraced by such atrocities. Think, think of the aged poor
torn from their kindred, caged in a prison, refused all aid within,
debarred from every hope without,&mdash;think of the flesh, the
very flesh, rotting by slow degrees, and then in putrid masses
falling from their wretched bones: think, we say, on
this&mdash;then give what name you can, save murder, to their
quickly succeeding death.</p>
<p>Fancy children&mdash;children that should be in their
prime&mdash;so caged and fed that the result is disease in its most
loathsome form, and with all its most appalling consequences! No
hope! no flight! The yet untainted, as it were, chained to the
spot, with mute despair watching the slow infection, and with
breaking hearts awaiting the hour&mdash;the moment&mdash;when it
<em>must</em> reach to them!</p>
<p>We say, think of these things&mdash;not as if they were the
doings in England, and therefore legalised matters of
course&mdash;but think of them as the arts of some despot in a
far-off colony, and oh, how all hearts would burn&mdash;all tongues
curse and call for vengeance on the abetors of such atrocities!</p>
<p>The supporters of the rights of man would indeed pour forth
their eloquent denunciations against the oppressors of the absent.
The poetry of passion would be exhausted to depict the frightful
state of the crimeless and venerable victim of tyranny, bowing his
grey hairs with sorrow to the grave; while the wailing of the
helpless innocents <em>different indeed in colour</em>, but in
heart and spirit like ourselves, being sprung from the one great
source, would echo throughout the land, and find responses in every
bosom not lost to the kindly feelings of good-will towards its
fellows! Had the would-be esteemed philanthropists but these
&ldquo;<em>foreign cues</em> for passion,&rdquo; they would
indeed</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">&ldquo;Drown the stage with tears,</p>
<p>And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;</p>
<p>Make mad the guilty, and appal the free;</p>
<p>Confound the ignorant; and amaze, indeed,</p>
<p>The very faculties of eyes and ears.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But, alas! there is no such motive; these most destitute of
Destitution&rsquo;s children are simply fellow-countrymen and
fellow-Christians. Sons of the same soil, and worshippers of the
same God, they need no good works in the way of proselyzation to
save them from eternal perdition; consequently they receive no help
to keep them from temporal torture.</p>
<p>To convince themselves that these remarks are neither
unwarrantably severe, nor in the slightest degree overcharged, let
our readers not only refer to the revolting doings chronicled in
the <em>Times</em>, but let them find the further illustration of
this <em>foreign penchant</em> in the recent doings at the
magnificently-attended ball given in behalf of the <em>Polish
Refugees</em>, and consequently commanding the support of the
humane, enlightened, and charitable English; and then let them cast
their eyes over the cold shoulder turned towards a proposition for
the <em>same</em> act of charity being consummated for the relief
of the poverty-stricken and starving families of the destitute and
deserving artisans now literally starving under their very eyes,
located no farther off than in the wretched locality of
Spitalfields! An opinion&mdash;and doubtless an honest one&mdash;is
given by the Lord Mayor, that any attempt to relieve <em>their
wants</em>, in the way found so efficacious for <em>the Polish
Refugees</em>, would be madness, inasmuch as it would, <em>as
heretofore</em>, prove an absolute failure. Reader, is there
anything of the cuckoo and the sparrow in the above assertion? Is
it not true? And if it is so, is it not a more than crying evil? Is
it not a most vile blot upon our laws&mdash;a most beastly libel
upon our creed and our country? Is no relief ever to be given to
the immediate objects who should be the persons benefited by our
bounty? Are those who, in the prosperity proceeding from their
unceasing and ill-paid toil, added their quota to the succour of
others, now that poverty has fallen on them, to be left the sport
of fortune and the slaves of suffering? Do good, we say, in
God&rsquo;s name, to all, if good can be done to all. But do not
rob the lamb of its natural due&mdash;its mother&rsquo;s
nourishment&mdash;to waste it on an alien. There is no spirit of
illiberality in these remarks; they are put forward to advocate the
rights of our own destitute countrymen&mdash;to claim for them a
share of the lavish commiseration bestowed on others&mdash;to call
attention to the desolation of <em>their</em> hearths&mdash;the
wreck of their comforts&mdash;the awful condition of their starving
and dependent families&mdash;and to give the really charitable an
opportunity of reserving some of their kindnesses for home
consumption. Let this be their <em>just</em> object, and not one
among the relieved would withhold his mite from their suffering
fellows in other climes. But in Heaven&rsquo;s name, let the adage
root itself once more in every Englishman&rsquo;s &ldquo;heart of
hearts,&rdquo; and once more let &ldquo;Charity begin at
home!&rdquo;</p>

<h3>THE FIRE AT THE ADELPHI THEATRE.</h3>
<p>Yates was nearly treating the enlightened British public with an
antidote to &ldquo;the vast receptacle of 8,000 tons of
water,&rdquo; by setting fire to the saloon chimney. Great as the
consternation of the audience was in the front, it was far exceeded
by the alarm of the actors behind the curtain, for they are so
sensible of the manager&rsquo;s daring genius, that they concluded
he had set fire to the house in order to convert &ldquo;the space
usually devoted to <em>illusion</em> into the area of
reality.&rdquo; The great Mr. Freeborn actually rushed out of the
theatre without his rouge. Little Paul drank off a glass of neat
water. Mr. John Sanders was met at the end of Maiden Lane, with his
legs thrust into the sleeves of his coat, and the rest of his body
encased in the upper part of a property dragon; whilst little round
Wilkinson was vainly endeavouring to squeeze himself into a wooden
waterspout. Had he succeeded he might have applied for the reward
offered by the Royal Society for a method of</p>

<p><span class="hide">S</span>ir Robert Peel and her
Majesty&rsquo;s Ministers have, we learn, taken a hint in criminal
jurisprudence from his Worship the Mayor of Reading, and are now
preparing a bill for Parliament, which they trust will be the means
of checking the alarming desire for food which has begun to spread
amongst the poorer classes of society. The crime of eating has
latterly been indulged in to such an immoderate extent by the
operatives of Yorkshire and the other manufacturing districts, that
we do not wonder at our sagacious Premier adopting strong measures
to suppress the unnatural and increasing appetites of the
people.</p>
<p>Taking up the sound judicial views of the great functionary
above alluded to, who committed Bernard Cavanagh, the fasting man,
to prison for smelling at a saveloy and a slice of ham, Sir Robert
has laid down a graduated&mdash;we mean a
<em>sliding&mdash;scale</em> of penalties for the crime of eating,
proportioning, with the most delicate skill, the exact amount of
the punishment to the enormity of the offence. By his profound
wisdom he has discovered that the great increase of crime in these
countries is entirely attributable to over-feeding the multitude.
Like the worthy Mr. Bumble, in &ldquo;Oliver Twist,&rdquo; he
protests &ldquo;it is meat and not madness&rdquo; that ails the
people. He can even trace the origin of every felony to the
particular kind of food in which the felon has indulged. He detects
incipient incendiarism in eggs and fried bacon&mdash;homicide in an
Irish stew&mdash;robbery and house-breaking in a basin of
mutton-broth&mdash;and an aggravated assault in a pork sausage.
Upon this noble and statesmanlike theory Sir Robert has based a
bill which, when it becomes the law of the land, will, we feel
assured, tend effectually to keep the rebellious stomachs of the
people in a state of wholesome depletion. And as we now punish
those offenders who break the Queen&rsquo;s peace, we shall, in
like manner, then inflict the law upon the hungry scoundrels who
dare to break the Queen&rsquo;s Fast.</p>
<p>We have been enabled, through a private source, to obtain the
following authentic copy of Sir Robert&rsquo;s scale of the
offences under the intended Act, with the penalty attached to each,
viz.:</p>
<table summary="Eating penalties" style="width:80%;margin:auto;">
<tr>
<td>For penny rolls or busters</td>
<td>Imprisonment not exceeding a week.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>For bread of any kind, with cheese or butter</td>
<td>Imprisonment for a month.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>For saveloys, German sausages, and Black puddings</td>
<td>One month's imprisonment, with hard labour.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>For a slice of ham, bacon, or meat of any kind</td>
<td>Imprisonment for three months, and exercise on the
treadmill.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>For a hearty dinner on beef and pudding</td>
<td>Transportation for seven years.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>For do. with a pot of home-brewed ale.</td>
<td>Transportation for life.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>As these offences apply only to those who have no right to eat,
the wealthy and respectable portion of society need be under no
apprehension that they will be exposed to any inconvenience by the
operation of the new law.</p>

<h3>NOBODY CARES AND*</h3>
<p>WELLINGTON has justified his claim to the <em>sobriquet</em> of
&lsquo;the iron Duke&rsquo; by the manner in which he treated the
deputation from Paisley. His Grace excused himself from listening
to the tale of misery which several gentlemen had travelled 500
miles to narrate to him, on the plea that he was not a Minister of
the Crown. Yet we have a right to presume that the Queen prorogued
Parliament upon his Grace&rsquo;s recommendation, so if he be not
one of Peel&rsquo;s Cabinet what is he? We suppose</p>

<hr />
<h3>HINTS HOW TO ENJOY AN OMNIBUS.</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On getting in, care neither for toes or knees of the passengers;
but drive your way up to the top, steadying yourself by the
shoulders, chests, or even faces of those seated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seat yourself with a jerk, pushing against one neighbour, and
thrusting your elbow into the side of the other. You will thus get
plenty of room.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If possible, enter with a stick or umbrella, pointed at full
length; so that any sudden move of the &ldquo;bus&rdquo; may thrust
it into some one&rsquo;s stomach. It will make you feared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When seated, occupy, if possible, the room of two, and revenge
the treatment you have received on entering, by throwing every
opposition in the way of a new-comer, especially if it be a woman
with a child in her arms. It is a good plan to rest firmly on your
umbrella, with your arms at right angles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open or shut windows as it suits you; men with colds, or women
with toothaches, have no business in omnibuses. If they don&rsquo;t
like it, they can get out; no one <em>forces</em> them to ride.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Young bucks may stare any decent woman out of countenance, put
their legs up along the seats, and if going out to dinner, wipe the
mud off their boots on the seats. They are only plush.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If middle-aged gentlemen are musical or political, they can
dislocate a tune in something between a bark and a grumble, or
endeavour to provoke an argument by declaring very loudly that Lord
R&mdash;&mdash; or the Duke &ldquo;is a thorough scoundrel,&rdquo;
according to their opinion of public affairs. If this don&rsquo;t
take, they can keep up a perpetual squabble with the conductor,
which will show they think themselves of some importance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ladies wishing to be agreeable can bring lap dogs, large paper
parcels, and children, to whom an omnibus is a ship, though you
wish you were out of their reach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conductors should particularly aim to take up laundresses

<p>For want of space, the following brevities must
suffice:&mdash;Never say where you wish to stop until after you
have passed the place, and then pull them up with a sudden jerk.
Keep your money in your waistcoat-pocket, and button your under and
upper coat completely, and never attempt to get at it until the
door is opened, and then let it be nothing under a five-shilling
piece. Never ask any one to speak to the conductor for you, but hit
or poke him with your umbrella or stick, or rap his hand as it
rests on the door. He puts it there on purpose. Always stop the
wrong omnibus, and ask if the Paddington goes to Walworth, and the
Kennington to Whitechapel: you are not obliged to read all the
rigmarole they paint on the outside. Finally, consider an omnibus
as a carriage, a bed, a public-house, a place of amusement, or a
boxing-ring, where you may ride, sleep, smoke, chaff, or quarrel,
as it may suit you.</p>

<p>The <em>Examiner</em> states that there is no such fabric as

<p>A well-dressed individual has lately been visiting the

lodgings&mdash;but being, as he says, just arrived from a long
journey, he begs to have dinner before he returns to the
Coach-Office for his luggage. This request being usually complied
with, the new lodger, while the table is being laid, watches his
opportunity and bolts with the silver spoons. Sir Peter Laurie
says, that since this practice of filching the spoons has
commenced, he does not feel himself safe in his own house. He only
hopes the thief may be brought before him, and he promises to give
him his <em>dessert</em>, by committing him without</p>

<h3>LAURIE&rsquo;S RAILLERY.</h3>
<p>When Sir Peter Laurie had taken his seat the other morning in
that Temple of Momus, the Guildhall Justice Room, he was thus
addressed by Payne, the clerk&mdash;&ldquo;I see, Sir Peter, an
advertisement in the <em>Times</em>, announcing the sale of shares
in the railroad from Paris to ROUEN; would you advise me to invest
a little loose cash in that speculation?&rdquo; &ldquo;Certainly
not,&rdquo; replied the Knight, &ldquo;nor in any other
railway,&mdash;depend upon it, they all lead to the same terminus,
RUIN.&rdquo; Payne, having exclaimed that this was the best thing
he had ever heard, was presented by our own Alderman with a
shilling, accompanied with a request that he would get his hair
cropped to the magisterial standard.</p>

<p>At the sale of the library of the late Theodore Hook, a curious
copy of &ldquo;The Complete Jester&rdquo; was knocked down to
&ldquo;our own&rdquo; Colonel. Delighted with his prize, he ran
home, intending to lay in a fresh stock of <em>bons mots</em>; but
what was his amazement on finding that all the jokes contained in
the volume were those with which he has been in the habit of
entertaining the public these last forty years! Sibby declares that
the sight of so many old friends actually brought the tears into
his eyes.</p>
<hr class="full" />
<h2>PUNCH&rsquo;S THEATRE.</h2>
<h3>LOVE EXTEMPORE.</h3>
<p>As the hero of a romantic play is obliged to possess all the
cardinal virtues and all the intellectual accomplishments, so the
hero of a farce is bound to be a fool. One of the greatest, and at
the same time one of the best fools it has been our pleasure to be
introduced to for some time is <em>Mr. Titus Livingstone</em>, in
the new farce of &ldquo;Love Extempore.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Mr. Titus Livingstone</em> possesses an excellent heart, a
good fortune, and an uncommon stock of modesty. His intellects are,
however, far from brilliant; indeed, but for one trait in his
character he would pass for an idiot,&mdash;he has had the good
sense never as yet to fall in love! In fact, the farce is founded
upon that identical incident of his life which occasioned him to
suppose that he had taken the tender passion extempore.</p>
<p>Some sort of villany seems absolutely necessary to every species
of play. To continue the parallel we commenced with between tragedy
and farce, we observe that in the former he is usually such a
person as <em>Spinola</em>, in &ldquo;Nina Sforza,&rdquo; whilst a
farce-villain turns out to be in most instances an intriguing
widow, a lawyer, or a mischievous young lady. The rogue in
&ldquo;Love Extempore&rdquo; is <em>Mrs. Courtnay</em>, a widow,
who, with the assistance of <em>Sir Harry Nugent</em>, contrives a
plot by which the hitherto insensible <em>Livingstone</em> shall
fall a victim to love and her friend <em>Prudence Oldstock</em>;
with whose mother and sister the widow and her co-intriguant are
staying on a visit.</p>
<p>The moment fatal to Livingstone&rsquo;s virgin heart and
unrestrained liberty arrives. He calls to pay a morning visit, and
instantly the deep design is put into execution. <em>Sir Harry</em>
begins by a most extravagant puff preliminary of the talents,
accomplishments, virtues, beauty, disposition, endowments, and
graces belonging to the enchanting <em>Prudence</em>. He and the
widow exhibit her drawings,&mdash;<em>Livingstone</em> is in
raptures, or pretends to be (for he is not an ill-bred man). What a
piercing expression flashes from those studies of eyes (in chalk)!
what an artistical grouping of legs! what a
Saracen&rsquo;s-head-upon-Snow-hill-like ferocity frowns from that
Indian chief!</p>
<p>At this juncture the captivating artist is herself introduced.
<em>Mr. Livingstone&rsquo;s</em> modesty strikes him into a heap of
confusion. &ldquo;He sighs and looks, and looks and sighs
again,&rdquo;&mdash;he does not know &ldquo;what to say, or how to
say it; so that the trembling bachelor may become a wise and good
lover.&rdquo; He stutters and hems in the utmost distress; to
increase which, all his tormentors turn up the stage, leaving him
to entertain the lady alone. The sketches naturally suggest a
topic, and, plunging <em>in medias res</em> at once, he vehemently
praises her legs! The lady is astonished, and the mamma alarmed;
but having explained that the allusion was to the drawings, he is
afterwards punished for the blunder by being threatened with a
song. Though at a loss to find out what he has done to deserve such
an infliction, he submits; for he is very sleepy, and sinks into a
chair in an attitude of supposed attention, but really in a posture
best adapted for a nap. When the song is ended the applause of
course comes in; this awakens <em>Livingstone</em> in a fright; he
starts, and throws down a harp in his fall.</p>
<p>After this <em>contretemps</em>, the villany of the widow and
her ally takes a different turn. In a love affair there are
generally two parties; and <em>Miss Prudence</em> has got to be
persuaded that <em>she</em> is in love. This it is not difficult to
accomplish, she being no more overburdened with penetration than
the gentleman they are so kind as to say she is in love with. So
far all goes on well: for she is soon convinced that she is
enamoured to the last extremity.</p>
<p><em>Livingstone</em> having a sort of glimmering that the danger
so long averted at length impends over him&mdash;that he is falling
into the trap of love, with every chance of the fall continuing
down to the bottomless pit of matrimony, determines to avert the
catastrophe by flight. The pair of villains, however, set up a cry
of &ldquo;Stop thief,&rdquo; and he is brought back. <em>Sir
Harry</em> appeals to his feelings. Good gracious! is he so base,
so dishonourable, so heartless, to rob an innocent, unsuspecting,
and accomplished girl of her heart, and then wickedly desert her!
Oh, no! In short, having already persuaded the poor man that he is
in love, <em>Sir Harry</em> convinces him that he would also be a
deceiver; and <em>Livingstone</em> would have returned like a lamb
to the slaughter but for a new incident.</p>
<p>He has an uncle who is engaged in a law-suit with some of
<em>Mrs. Courtnay&rsquo;s</em> family. To bring this litigation to
an amicable end it has been proposed that <em>Livingstone</em>
should marry the widow&rsquo;s sister. Here is a discovery! So, the
deep widow has been unwittingly plotting against her own sister!
Things must be altered; and so they are, in no time, for she
persuades the easy hero that <em>Nugent</em> is in love with
<em>Prudence</em> himself; but, finding she adores her new lover,
has magnanimously given up his claims in his favour. This has the
desired effect, for <em>Livingstone</em> will have no such noble
sacrifice made on his account. He seeks <em>Sir Harry</em>; who,
discovering the double design of the profound widow, talks as
immensely magnanimous as they do in classic dramas. In short, both
play at Romans till the end of the piece; the hero and heroine
being at last fully persuaded that they have each really fallen in
&ldquo;Love Extempore!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This idea of persuading two persons into the bonds of
love&mdash;of having all the courting done at second-hand, is
admirably worked out. <em>Livingstone</em> is a well-drawn
character; so well, so naturally painted, that he hardly deserves
to be the hero of a farce. Although exceedingly soft, he is a
well-bred fool&mdash;though somewhat fat (for the actor is Mr.
David Rees); he is not altogether inelegant. The gentleman who does
the theatrical metaphysics in the <em>Morning Herald</em> has
described him as a capital specimen of &ldquo;physical obesity and
moral teunity,&rdquo;<sup>3</sup><span class="sidenote">3.
<em>Sic</em>, actually, in the dramatic article of that paper,
Wednesday, 24th ult.</span> &mdash;which we quote to save ourselves
trouble, for the force of description can no further go.
<em>Prudence</em> is also inimitable&mdash;a march-of-intellect
young lady without brains, who knows the names of the five large
rivers in America, and how many bones there are in the gills of a
turbot. In Miss P. Horton&rsquo;s hands her mechanical acquirements
were done ample justice to. The cold unmeaning love scene was
rendered mainly by her acting</p>

<p>A N-ICE SITUATION.</p>

<p>In fine, the farce is altogether a leaven of the best material
most cleverly worked up.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
